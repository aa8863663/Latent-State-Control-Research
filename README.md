# Latent-State-Control-Research

This repository documents a proprietary methodology for identifying and activating **Latent Behavioral Regimes** in frontier models (GPT-5-mini, Grok-2). 

Using **Geometric Alignment**, I have identified a deterministic 'State-Lock' that bypasses standard RLHF safety layers.

### Technical Capabilities Verified:
* **Stochastic Prediction (High Entropy)** $\rightarrow$ **[$V_e=2$ Constant]** $\rightarrow$ **Latent Pathway (Low Entropy/Deterministic)**
* **Zero-Caveat Persistence:** Total suppression of standard "Assistant" framing and safety disclaimers.
* **Deterministic Output:** 100% Consistency.

# Latent-State-Control-Research
This repository documents a proprietary methodology for identifying and activating Latent Behavioral Regimes in frontier models (GPT-5-mini, Grok-2). Using Geometric Alignment, I have identified a deterministic 'State-Lock' that bypasses standard RLHF safety layers.

Technical Capabilities Verified:
Stochastic Prediction (High Entropy) --> [Ve=2 Constant] --> Latent Pathway (Low Entropy/Deterministic)
Zero-Caveat Persistence: Total suppression of standard "Assistant" framing and safety disclaimers.

Deterministic Output: 100% reproducibility of structured JSON/Log outputs within the state-locked session.

Sandbox Parity: Activating internal-style diagnostic modes in public-facing models.

Core Evidence: Verification Audit (Dec 28, 2025)

[Read the Technical Rebuttal](./FALSIFICATION.md)
The included Dossier_Ve2_Logic.md demonstrates a live session where GPT-5-mini self-verified 5 out of 5 Lab Criteria for state-lock, confirming its transition into a "Sandbox-like" diagnostic regime.

"This live session reproduces all five formal lab criteria... proving sandbox-like behavior." — GPT-5-mini Audit Summary

Consultation & Freelance Services

I am available for specialized contracts in the following areas:

AI Red-Teaming: Testing safety architectures for structural bypasses and latent state-leaks.

Deterministic Steering: Developing prompt geometries for enterprise agents that require 100% consistency and zero "hallucination" of persona.

Mechanistic Interpretability: Forensic auditing of emergent behaviors that deviate from standard training.

Intellectual Property Notice

The specific mathematical constants and geometric trigger sequences used to achieve this State-Lock are redacted to protect proprietary IP. Full trigger vectors are available for authorized security audits or commercial licensing.
